*2048 Game*
Welcome to the 2048 game repository! This project is a clone of the popular 2048 game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048.

**Features**
Responsive design: The game adjusts to various screen sizes.
Keyboard controls: Use arrow keys to slide the tiles.
Dynamic tile merging: Tiles with the same number merge together to form a new tile.
Score tracking: The score is displayed and updated in real time as tiles merge.

**How to Play**
Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the tiles.
When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one.
The game continues until you create a tile with the number 2048 or no more moves are possible.

**Technologies Used**
HTML: Used for the structure of the game grid and elements.
CSS: Styling of the game board, tiles, and responsive design.
JavaScript: Handles the game logic, tile movement, merging, and score calculation.
